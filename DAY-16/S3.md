### 5. S3 Replication: SRR & CRR
#### **A. Same-Region Replication (SRR)**
- Replicates objects within **the same AWS region**.
- Use cases:
  - Maintain separate copies for **compliance and backups**.
  - **Replicating objects with different storage classes**.
- **Key Points:**
  - Bucket versioning must be enabled.
  - Permissions need to be set for destination buckets.

#### **B. Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**
- Replicates objects to **a different AWS region**.
- Use cases:
  - **Disaster recovery** in a different region.
  - **Low-latency access** for global users.
  - **Compliance requirements** demanding multi-region storage.
- **Key Points:**
  - Bucket versioning must be enabled.
  - IAM role permissions must allow replication.
  - Data transfer costs apply between regions.
