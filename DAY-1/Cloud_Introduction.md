# Introduction to Cloud Computing

## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing
1. On-Demand Self-Service – Users can provision resources as needed without human intervention.
2. Broad Network Access – Cloud services are accessible over the internet from anywhere.
4. Rapid Elasticity – Resources can scale up or down based on demand.
5. Measured Service – Users pay only for the resources they use (pay-as-you-go model).

## Types of Cloud Computing
1. Public Cloud – Services are offered over the internet by third-party providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
2. Private Cloud – Dedicated infrastructure for a single organization, offering better control and security.
3. Hybrid Cloud – A combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.


## Benefits of Cloud Computing
Cost Efficiency – No need for upfront investment in hardware.

Scalability – Easily scale resources up or down.

Flexibility – Access resources from anywhere.

Security & Reliability – Cloud providers offer advanced security features and backup options.

Automatic Updates – Providers handle maintenance and software updates


# Introduction to AWS
## 1. What is AWS?
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. It offers a wide range of services such as computing power, storage, databases, networking, and security. AWS enables businesses and developers to build, deploy, and manage applications efficiently without investing in physical infrastructure.

## Key Features of AWS
Scalability – Resources can be scaled up or down as per demand.

Cost-Effective – Pay-as-you-go pricing model.

Security – Built-in security features and compliance with global standards.

Flexibility – Supports multiple programming languages and platforms.

Global Reach – Available in multiple regions worldwide.

## 2. AWS Global Infrastructure
AWS operates in different locations worldwide. Understanding the AWS infrastructure is crucial for designing scalable and resilient applications.

### Key Components:
Regions – A geographical area containing multiple AWS data centers.

Availability Zones (AZs) – Data centers within a region that provide redundancy.

Edge Locations – Used by AWS CloudFront for content delivery and caching.

## 3. AWS Core Services
AWS provides a wide range of services categorized into different domains:

## A. Compute Services

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) – Virtual servers in the cloud.

AWS Lambda – Serverless compute service that runs code in response to events.

Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) – Manages Docker containers.

Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) – Manages Kubernetes clusters.


## B. Storage Services

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) – Scalable object storage.

Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) – Persistent storage for EC2.

Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) – Scalable file storage.

AWS Backup – Centralized backup service.


## C. Database Services

Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) – Managed database service for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server.

Amazon DynamoDB – Fully managed NoSQL database.

Amazon Redshift – Data warehousing service.

Amazon Aurora – High-performance relational database.


## D. Networking & Content Delivery

Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) – Isolated cloud environment.

AWS Route 53 – Domain Name System (DNS) service.

AWS CloudFront – Content delivery network (CDN).

AWS Direct Connect – Dedicated network connection to AWS.


## E. Security & Identity

AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) – Manages user permissions.

AWS KMS (Key Management Service) – Encryption key management.

AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) – Protects applications from attacks.

AWS Shield – DDoS protection service.


## 4. AWS Billing & Pricing

AWS follows a pay-as-you-go model, meaning you pay only for what you use.

Pricing Models:
On-Demand – Pay for what you use, no long-term commitment.

Reserved Instances – Commit for 1-3 years for a discount.

Spot Instances – Purchase unused capacity at lower prices.

Savings Plans – Flexible pricing model based on usage commitment.


## 5. AWS Management & Monitoring

AWS CloudWatch – Monitoring service for logs and performance metrics.

AWS CloudTrail – Logs all AWS API calls for auditing.

AWS Config – Tracks changes in AWS resources.

AWS Trusted Advisor – Provides recommendations for security and cost optimization.
