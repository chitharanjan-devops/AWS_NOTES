# Introduction to Cloud Computing

## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more—over the internet ("the cloud"). Instead of owning and maintaining physical infrastructure, users can access computing resources on-demand from cloud providers.

## Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing
1. On-Demand Self-Service – Users can provision resources as needed without human intervention.
2. Broad Network Access – Cloud services are accessible over the internet from anywhere.
3. Resource Pooling – Computing resources are shared among multiple users dynamically.
4. Rapid Elasticity – Resources can scale up or down based on demand.
5. Measured Service – Users pay only for the resources they use (pay-as-you-go model).

## Types of Cloud Computing
1. Public Cloud – Services are offered over the internet by third-party providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
2. Private Cloud – Dedicated infrastructure for a single organization, offering better control and security.
3. Hybrid Cloud – A combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

## Cloud Service Models
1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) – Provides virtualized computing resources like servers, storage, and networking (e.g., AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine).
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS) – Offers a platform for developers to build and deploy applications (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine).
3. Software as a Service (SaaS) – Delivers software applications over the internet (e.g., Gmail, Dropbox, Microsoft 365).

## Benefits of Cloud Computing
Cost Efficiency – No need for upfront investment in hardware.
Scalability – Easily scale resources up or down.
Flexibility – Access resources from anywhere.
Security & Reliability – Cloud providers offer advanced security features and backup options.
Automatic Updates – Providers handle maintenance and software updates
